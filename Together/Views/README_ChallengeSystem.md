# Challenge System Implementation

## Overview
The Challenge System provides daily challenges for couples to complete together, strengthening their bond through shared activities across four categories: communication, fun, appreciation, and learning.

## Components Created

### Domain Layer
- **IChallengeRepository** (`Together.Domain/Interfaces/IChallengeRepository.cs`)
  - Interface for challenge data access
  - Methods: GetByIdAsync, GetActiveChallengesAsync, GetExpiredChallengesAsync, GetTodaysChallengeAsync, AddAsync, UpdateAsync, DeleteAsync, GetCoupleScoreAsync

### Infrastructure Layer
- **ChallengeRepository** (`Together.Infrastructure/Repositories/ChallengeRepository.cs`)
  - Implements IChallengeRepository
  - Handles database operations for challenges
  - Calculates couple score from completed challenges

### Application Layer
- **IChallengeService** (`Together.Application/Interfaces/IChallengeService.cs`)
  - Service interface for challenge business logic
  
- **ChallengeService** (`Together.Application/Services/ChallengeService.cs`)
  - Implements challenge generation, completion tracking, and archival
  - Validates user permissions and challenge expiration
  - Manages couple score calculation

- **ChallengeFactory** (`Together.Application/Services/ChallengeService.cs`)
  - Static factory class with predefined challenge templates
  - Four categories with 8 challenges each:
    - **Communication**: Deep questions, gratitude, active listening, future dreams
    - **Fun**: Dance party, cooking, games, photo challenges, outdoor adventures
    - **Appreciation**: Love letters, quality time, surprise gestures, massages
    - **Learning**: Teaching skills, reading together, documentaries, goal setting
  - Random challenge generation
  - Category-specific challenge creation

- **ChallengeDto** (`Together.Application/DTOs/ChallengeDto.cs`)
  - Data transfer object for challenges
  - Properties: Id, Title, Description, Category, Points, ExpiresAt, CompletedByUser1, CompletedByUser2, CreatedAt, IsFullyCompleted, IsExpired

### Presentation Layer
- **ChallengeViewModel** (`Together/ViewModels/ChallengeViewModel.cs`)
  - Manages challenge UI state and user interactions
  - Commands: CompleteChallengeCommand, GenerateNewChallengeCommand, RefreshCommand, SelectChallengeCommand
  - Properties: ActiveChallenges, SelectedChallenge, CoupleScore, IsLoading, ErrorMessage, HasNoChallenges
  - Handles challenge completion with partner tracking
  - Displays success messages and score updates

- **ChallengeCard** (`Together/Controls/ChallengeCard.xaml`)
  - Custom control for displaying individual challenges
  - Shows category badge, title, description, points value
  - Visual indicators for completion status (both partners)
  - Expiration date display with color coding
  - Highlights fully completed challenges

- **ChallengeView** (`Together/Views/ChallengeView.xaml`)
  - Main view for challenge management
  - Header with couple total score display
  - Action buttons: Generate New Challenge, Complete Selected, Refresh
  - ListBox with challenge cards
  - Loading indicator and error message display
  - Empty state for no active challenges

- **InverseBooleanToVisibilityConverter** (`Together/Converters/InverseBooleanToVisibilityConverter.cs`)
  - Converter for showing/hiding UI elements based on inverted boolean values

## Features Implemented

### Challenge Generation
- Daily challenge generation at midnight (or on-demand)
- Random selection from 32 predefined challenges across 4 categories
- 24-hour expiration window
- Points system (10-20 points per challenge)
- Prevents duplicate daily challenges

### Challenge Completion
- Individual completion tracking for both partners
- Visual indicators showing who has completed the challenge
- Automatic score calculation when both partners complete
- Success notifications with points earned
- Validation to prevent completing expired challenges

### Couple Score Tracking
- Cumulative score from all completed challenges
- Prominent display in header with star icon
- Real-time updates after challenge completion

### Challenge Categories
1. **Communication** (10-20 points)
   - Encourages meaningful conversations and emotional connection
   - Examples: Share your day, ask deep questions, express gratitude

2. **Fun** (10-20 points)
   - Promotes playful activities and shared experiences
   - Examples: Dance party, cook together, game night, photo challenge

3. **Appreciation** (15-20 points)
   - Fosters gratitude and romantic gestures
   - Examples: Love letter, quality time, surprise gesture, massage exchange

4. **Learning** (10-20 points)
   - Encourages growth and knowledge sharing
   - Examples: Teach something new, watch documentaries, set goals

### UI Features
- Material Design styling with cards and icons
- Category badges with color coding
- Completion status indicators (checkmarks for each partner)
- Expired challenge highlighting
- Selectable challenge cards
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state guidance

## Business Rules

1. **One Daily Challenge**: Only one challenge can be generated per day per couple
2. **24-Hour Expiration**: Challenges expire 24 hours after creation
3. **Both Partners Required**: Full completion requires both partners to mark as complete
4. **Points Award**: Points only awarded when both partners complete the challenge
5. **No Expired Completion**: Cannot complete challenges after expiration
6. **Connection Validation**: Users must be part of the couple connection to complete challenges

## Integration Requirements

### Dependency Injection Registration
Add to `App.xaml.cs` or DI configuration:

```csharp
// Repository
services.AddScoped<IChallengeRepository, ChallengeRepository>();

// Service
services.AddScoped<IChallengeService, ChallengeService>();

// ViewModel (if using DI for ViewModels)
services.AddTransient<ChallengeViewModel>();
```

### Navigation
Add challenge view to navigation menu:
```csharp
NavigationService.RegisterView<ChallengeViewModel, ChallengeView>();
```

### Background Task (Optional)
For automatic daily challenge generation at midnight:
```csharp
// In a background service or timer
await challengeService.GenerateDailyChallengeAsync(connectionId);
await challengeService.ArchiveExpiredChallengesAsync();
```

## Database Requirements

The Challenge entity is already configured in `TogetherDbContext` with:
- Table: `challenges`
- Indexes on: `ConnectionId`, `ExpiresAt`, `CreatedAt`
- Foreign key to `couple_connections` table
- Constraints on category values

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Test challenge factory random generation
- Test category-specific challenge creation
- Test completion logic for both partners
- Test score calculation
- Test expiration validation

### Integration Tests
- Test challenge generation with database
- Test completion workflow end-to-end
- Test score persistence and retrieval
- Test expired challenge archival

### UI Tests
- Test challenge selection
- Test completion button enabling/disabling
- Test score display updates
- Test empty state display

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Challenges**: Allow couples to create their own challenges
2. **Challenge History**: View completed challenges with timestamps
3. **Streak Tracking**: Track consecutive days of challenge completion
4. **Difficulty Levels**: Add easy/medium/hard challenge variations
5. **Achievements**: Unlock badges for milestone completions
6. **Challenge Sharing**: Share favorite challenges with other couples
7. **Notifications**: Remind partners about pending challenges
8. **Analytics**: Track which categories are most popular
9. **Seasonal Challenges**: Special challenges for holidays/seasons
10. **Challenge Packs**: Themed challenge collections
