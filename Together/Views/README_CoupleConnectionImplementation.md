13. `Together/Views/README_CoupleConnectionImplementation.md` - This file
14. `Together.Infrastructure/Migrations/README_ConnectionRequestMigration.md` - Migration guide

#### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ User search functionality (by username or email)
- ✅ Connection request sending with validation
- ✅ Pending request list with user information
- ✅ Accept/reject buttons with confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Current connection status display
- ✅ Relationship statistics (days together, love streak)
- ✅ Connection termination with confirmation
- ✅ Material Design UI with proper styling
- ✅ Loading indicators and error handling
- ✅ Empty state displays

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
"WHEN a User sends a couple connection request to another User, THE Together System SHALL create a pending connection request"
- Implemented in `CoupleConnectionService.SendConnectionRequestAsync`

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
"WHEN a User receives a couple connection request, THE Together System SHALL notify the User and display the request for approval"
- Implemented in `ConnectionRequestNotificationView` with auto-load on view display

### Requirement 2.3 ✅
"WHEN a User accepts a couple connection request, THE Together System SHALL establish a mutual Couple Connection between both Users"
- Implemented in `CoupleConnectionService.AcceptConnectionRequestAsync`

### Requirement 2.4 ✅
"THE Together System SHALL limit each User to one active Couple Connection at any given time"
- Enforced in service layer with validation checks before creating requests or accepting

### Requirement 2.5 ✅
"WHEN a User terminates a Couple Connection, THE Together System SHALL archive shared data and remove access to couple-specific features"
- Implemented in `CoupleConnectionService.TerminateConnectionAsync` with status change to Terminated

## Next Steps

### Integration Tasks:
1. **Dependency Injection Setup**: Register services in `App.xaml.cs`
   ```csharp
   services.AddScoped<ICoupleConnectionService, CoupleConnectionService>();
   services.AddScoped<IConnectionRequestRepository, ConnectionRequestRepository>();
   services.AddScoped<ICoupleConnectionRepository, CoupleConnectionRepository>();
   ```

2. **Database Migration**: Run EF Core migration to create connection_requests table
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add AddConnectionRequest --project Together.Infrastructure --startup-project Together
   dotnet ef database update --project Together.Infrastructure --startup-project Together
   ```

3. **Navigation Integration**: Add navigation menu items for:
   - Send Connection Request
   - View Pending Requests
   - Connection Status

4. **Session Management**: Implement proper user session management to replace placeholder `GetCurrentUserId()` methods

5. **Real-time Notifications**: Integrate with SignalR to notify users of new connection requests in real-time

6. **Resource Dictionary**: Register converters in App.xaml:
   ```xml
   <Application.Resources>
       <converters:ZeroToVisibilityConverter x:Key="ZeroToVisibilityConverter"/>
       <converters:InverseBooleanToVisibilityConverter x:Key="InverseBooleanToVisibilityConverter"/>
   </Application.Resources>
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests:
- Test connection request creation with various scenarios
- Test one-connection-per-user rule enforcement
- Test duplicate request prevention
- Test connection acceptance and rejection
- Test connection termination

### Integration Tests:
- Test complete flow from request to acceptance
- Test concurrent request scenarios
- Test database constraints

### UI Tests:
- Test user search functionality
- Test request sending with validation
- Test accept/reject flows with confirmations
- Test connection status display

## Known Limitations

1. **Session Management**: Currently uses placeholder `Application.Current.Properties["CurrentUserId"]` - needs proper implementation
2. **Real-time Updates**: Views don't automatically refresh when new requests arrive - needs SignalR integration
3. **Relationship Start Date**: Currently defaults to today when accepting - could be customizable
4. **Request Expiration**: No automatic expiration of old pending requests
5. **Profile Pictures**: Not displayed in request notifications (only initials shown)

## Architecture Notes

- Follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Uses MVVM pattern for UI layer
- Implements Repository pattern for data access
- Uses DTOs for data transfer between layers
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Material Design UI components for consistent styling
