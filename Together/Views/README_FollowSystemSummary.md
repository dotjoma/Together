# Follow System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete follow system for the Together social-emotional hub application, enabling users to build social connections through follow relationships.

## Components Implemented

### Backend Services

#### 1. Domain Layer
- **IFollowRelationshipRepository**: Repository interface for follow relationship data access
  - Methods for CRUD operations on follow relationships
  - Queries for followers, following, and pending requests
  - Count methods for follower/following statistics

#### 2. Infrastructure Layer
- **FollowRelationshipRepository**: EF Core implementation of the repository
  - Efficient queries with proper includes for navigation properties
  - Filtering by status (pending, accepted)
  - Optimized count queries

#### 3. Application Layer
- **IFollowService**: Service interface defining follow operations
- **FollowService**: Business logic implementation
  - SendFollowRequestAsync: Creates pending follow relationships
  - AcceptFollowRequestAsync: Accepts pending requests
  - RejectFollowRequestAsync: Rejects and deletes requests
  - UnfollowAsync: Removes follow relationships
  - GetFollowersAsync/GetFollowingAsync: Retrieves relationship lists
  - GetFollowerCountAsync/GetFollowingCountAsync: Gets statistics
  - GetFollowStatusAsync: Determines relationship status between users

- **FollowRelationshipDto**: Data transfer object for follow relationships

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Custom Controls
- **FollowButton**: Reusable button control with state-based appearance
  - States: None, Pending, Accepted, Self
  - Material Design styling with appropriate icons
  - Command binding for follow actions

#### 2. Views
- **FollowRequestsView**: Displays and manages pending follow requests
  - Accept/Reject actions
  - User profile information display
  - Empty state handling

- **FollowerListView**: Shows all followers
  - Follower count display
  - Profile viewing capability
  - Empty state with helpful message

- **FollowingListView**: Shows all followed users
  - Following count display
  - Unfollow functionality with confirmation
  - Profile viewing capability
  - Empty state with guidance

#### 3. ViewModels
- **FollowRequestsViewModel**: Manages pending requests UI logic
- **FollowerListViewModel**: Manages followers list UI logic
- **FollowingListViewModel**: Manages following list UI logic

All ViewModels include:
- Observable collections for reactive updates
- Command implementations for user actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state detection

### Integration Updates

#### ProfileService Enhancement
- Updated to use FollowService for accurate follower/following counts
- Integrated counts into ProfileDto
- Maintains separation of concerns

#### Dependency Injection
- Registered IFollowRelationshipRepository and FollowRelationshipRepository
- Registered IFollowService and FollowService
- Updated ProfileService constructor with FollowService dependency

#### Tests
- Updated ProfileServiceTests to mock FollowService
- All 19 tests passing successfully

## Next Steps

The follow system is now complete and ready for integration with:
1. Navigation system (to navigate between views)
2. Real-time synchronization (for instant follow notifications)
3. Social feed (to display posts from followed users)
4. User search (to find users to follow)

The foundation is solid and extensible for future enhancements like:
- Follow suggestions based on mutual connections
- Batch operations
- Real-time notifications
- Infinite scrolling for large lists
