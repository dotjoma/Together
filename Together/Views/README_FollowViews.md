## Design Patterns Used

### Material Design
All views use Material Design components for consistent styling:
- Cards for list items
- Raised/Outlined buttons for actions
- PackIcons for visual indicators
- Proper spacing and typography

### MVVM Pattern
- Views are purely declarative XAML
- ViewModels handle all business logic
- Commands for user interactions
- Data binding for reactive updates

### Converters
- `StringToVisibilityConverter`: Shows/hides elements based on string values
- `BooleanToVisibilityConverter`: Shows/hides elements based on boolean values

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Success/error message boxes
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Profile pictures with fallback initials

### Responsive Design
- Scrollable lists for large datasets
- Proper spacing and padding
- Consistent card-based layout
- Clear action buttons

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation on failures

## Integration with Profile

The UserProfileView already includes follower/following counts:
```xaml
<StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="0,0,20,0">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Profile.FollowerCount}" FontWeight="Bold"/>
        <TextBlock Text="Followers"/>
    </StackPanel>
    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
        <TextBlock Text="{Binding Profile.FollowingCount}" FontWeight="Bold"/>
        <TextBlock Text="Following"/>
    </StackPanel>
</StackPanel>
```

These counts are populated by the ProfileService using the FollowService.

## Requirements Satisfied
- Requirement 12.2: Display follow requests for approval
- Requirement 12.4: Display follower and following counts on user walls
- Requirement 12.5: Unfollow functionality with UI

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time updates when new follow requests arrive
- Infinite scrolling for large follower/following lists
- Search/filter functionality
- Batch operations (accept all, etc.)
- Follow suggestions based on mutual connections
