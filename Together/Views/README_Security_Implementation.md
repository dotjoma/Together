# Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security measures implemented in the Together application to protect user data, prevent attacks, and ensure privacy compliance.

## Task 25.1: Data Protection and Validation

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Application/Interfaces/IInputValidator.cs`
- `Together.Application/Services/InputValidator.cs`

**Features:**
- Text sanitization to remove dangerous characters
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) pattern detection
- HTML sanitization
- File path validation (prevents directory traversal)
- URL validation

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses regex patterns to detect malicious input
- Encodes HTML entities to prevent XSS
- Validates file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Ensures URLs are HTTP/HTTPS only

**Integration:**
- Integrated into `AuthenticationService` for registration and login
- Validates username, email, and other user inputs
- Logs security violations via audit logger

### 2. Secure Token Storage (Windows Credential Manager)

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Application/Interfaces/ISecureTokenStorage.cs`
- `Together.Infrastructure/Services/WindowsCredentialTokenStorage.cs`

**Features:**
- Stores JWT tokens securely in Windows Credential Manager
- Uses P/Invoke to interact with Windows Credential API
- Supports store, retrieve, delete, and exists operations
- Automatic memory cleanup for sensitive data

**Security Benefits:**
- Tokens are encrypted by Windows
- Tokens persist across application restarts
- Tokens are isolated per user account
- No plaintext token storage in files or registry

**Usage:**
```csharp
await _tokenStorage.StoreTokenAsync("auth_token", jwtToken);
var token = await _tokenStorage.RetrieveTokenAsync("auth_token");
await _tokenStorage.DeleteTokenAsync("auth_token");
```

### 3. TLS 1.2+ Enforcement

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Infrastructure/Services/TlsConfigurationService.cs`

**Features:**
- Enforces TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 for all network connections
- Configures certificate validation
- Sets connection limits and timeouts
- Validates server certificates

**Implementation:**
- Configured in `App.xaml.cs` on application startup
- Uses `ServicePointManager` to set security protocols
- Production mode enforces strict certificate validation
- Development mode logs certificate warnings

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents downgrade attacks to older TLS versions
- Ensures all Supabase connections use strong encryption
- Validates server identity via certificates

### 4. Audit Logging

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Application/Interfaces/IAuditLogger.cs`
- `Together.Infrastructure/Services/AuditLogger.cs`

**Features:**
- Logs authentication events (login, registration, password reset)
- Logs data access events (who accessed what data)
- Logs privacy events (permission changes, visibility updates)
- Logs security violations (injection attempts, unauthorized access)

**Event Types:**
- Authentication: Login, logout, registration, password changes
- DataAccess: Reading sensitive couple data
- Privacy: Permission grants/revokes, visibility changes
- SecurityViolation: Injection attempts, unauthorized access attempts

**Integration:**
- Used in `AuthenticationService` for auth events
- Used in `PrivacyService` for access control violations
- Logs include correlation IDs for tracing

## Task 25.2: Privacy Controls

### 1. Privacy Service

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Application/Interfaces/IPrivacyService.cs`
- `Together.Application/Services/PrivacyService.cs`

**Features:**
- Couple data isolation checks
- Profile visibility enforcement
- Post visibility filtering
- Partner relationship validation

**Key Methods:**
- `HasCoupleDataAccessAsync`: Validates user is part of couple connection
- `CanViewProfileAsync`: Checks profile visibility settings
- `CanViewPostAsync`: Validates post access based on follow relationships
- `FilterVisibleUsersAsync`: Filters user lists by visibility
- `GetPartnerIdAsync`: Safely retrieves partner information

**Privacy Rules:**
- Public profiles: Visible to everyone
- Friends-only profiles: Visible only to accepted followers
- Private profiles: Visible only to the owner
- Couple data: Accessible only to the two partners

### 2. Repository Privacy Enhancements

**Updated Files:**
- `Together.Infrastructure/Repositories/JournalEntryRepository.cs`
- `Together.Infrastructure/Repositories/UserRepository.cs`
- `Together.Infrastructure/Repositories/PostRepository.cs`

**Enhancements:**
- Added privacy comments explaining isolation rules
- Journal entries filtered by connection ID
- User search respects profile visibility
- Post feed respects follow relationships
- All queries use parameterized queries (EF Core) to prevent SQL injection

### 3. Service Privacy Integration

**Updated Files:**
- `Together.Application/Services/JournalService.cs`
- `Together.Application/Services/AuthenticationService.cs`

**Enhancements:**
- JournalService validates couple data access before operations
- AuthenticationService sanitizes inputs and logs security violations
- All sensitive operations logged via audit logger

### 4. Location Permission Service

**Files Created:**
- `Together.Application/Interfaces/ILocationPermissionService.cs`
- `Together.Application/Services/LocationPermissionService.cs`

**Features:**
- Manages location permission state
- Tracks permission grants and revocations
- Controls location sharing with partner
- Logs all permission changes

**Privacy Compliance:**
- Explicit user consent required for location access
- Users can revoke permission at any time
- Location sharing with partner is opt-in
- All permission changes are audited

## Dependency Injection Registration

**Updated File:** `Together/App.xaml.cs`

**Registered Services:**
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IInputValidator, InputValidator>();
services.AddSingleton<ISecureTokenStorage, WindowsCredentialTokenStorage>();
services.AddSingleton<IAuditLogger, AuditLogger>();
services.AddScoped<IPrivacyService, PrivacyService>();
services.AddScoped<ILocationPermissionService, LocationPermissionService>();
```

**Startup Configuration:**
- TLS 1.2+ configured on application startup
- Audit logger available throughout application
- Privacy service injected into data access services

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of validation (input, business logic, database)
- Sanitization at entry points
- Validation at service layer
- Constraints at database layer

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users can only access their own data and partner's shared data
- Profile visibility controls what others can see
- Couple data strictly isolated by connection ID

### 3. Secure by Default
- TLS 1.2+ enforced automatically
- Profile visibility defaults to appropriate levels
- Location sharing requires explicit opt-in

### 4. Audit Trail
- All security-sensitive operations logged
- Authentication events tracked
- Privacy changes recorded
- Security violations flagged

### 5. Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized
- Injection patterns detected and blocked
- Malicious inputs logged as security violations

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
1. Test SQL injection attempts in login/registration
2. Test XSS attempts in post content and journal entries
3. Verify TLS version enforcement
4. Test unauthorized access to couple data
5. Verify profile visibility enforcement

### Privacy Testing
1. Test couple data isolation between different connections
2. Verify profile visibility settings work correctly
3. Test location permission flow
4. Verify audit logs capture all events

### Integration Testing

2. Verify privacy service integration in all data access paths
3. Test audit logging across all services
