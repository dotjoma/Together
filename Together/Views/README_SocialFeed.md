# Social Feed Implementation

## Overview
The social feed feature allows users to view posts from users they follow in a chronological feed with infinite scrolling, pull-to-refresh functionality, and suggested users when the feed is empty.

## Components Implemented

### Application Layer

#### ISocialFeedService Interface
- `GetFeedAsync(userId, skip, take)` - Retrieves paginated feed posts from followed users
- `GetSuggestedUsersAsync(userId, limit)` - Returns suggested users based on mutual connections
- `RefreshFeedCacheAsync(userId)` - Invalidates the feed cache for a user

#### SocialFeedService
- Implements feed aggregation from followed users
- Pagination support (20 posts per page by default)
- In-memory caching with 5-minute expiration for first page
- Suggested users algorithm based on mutual connections
- Falls back to random public users when no mutual connections exist

#### FeedResult DTO
- Contains posts collection, total count, and hasMore flag
- Used for pagination information

### Presentation Layer

#### SocialFeedViewModel
- Manages feed state (loading, refreshing, error messages)
- Implements infinite scroll with LoadMoreCommand
- Pull-to-refresh functionality with RefreshCommand
- Wraps PostDto objects in PostCardViewModel for proper display
- Shows suggested users when feed is empty
- Handles post deletion events

#### SocialFeedView (XAML)
- Header with refresh button
- Virtualized scrolling for performance (VirtualizingStackPanel)
- Loading indicators for initial load and refresh
- Error message display
- Suggested users section with profile pictures and follow buttons
- Posts list using PostCard control
- Load More button for pagination
- Empty state message

#### FirstLetterConverter
- Converts username to first letter for profile picture placeholder
- Used in suggested users section

## Features

### Feed Display
- Shows posts from followed users in reverse chronological order
- Displays post content, images, author info, and interaction counts
- Supports edit and delete for own posts (via PostCard)

### Pagination
- Initial load: 20 posts
- Infinite scroll with "Load More" button
- Tracks current position for seamless loading

### Caching
- First page cached for 5 minutes
- Cache invalidation on refresh
- Improves performance for frequent feed checks

### Suggested Users
- Shown when user has no posts in feed
- Based on mutual connections (friends of friends)
- Falls back to random public users
- Displays profile picture, username, bio
- Simple follow button for each suggestion

### Pull-to-Refresh
- Refresh button in header
- Invalidates cache and reloads feed
- Updates suggested users if feed becomes empty

### Error Handling
- Displays user-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation on service failures
- Maintains UI responsiveness during errors

## Dependencies

### NuGet Packages
- Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory (8.0.0) - For in-memory caching

### Services
- ISocialFeedService - Feed aggregation and suggestions
- IPostService - Post management (used by PostCardViewModel)
- IPostRepository - Data access for posts
- IFollowRelationshipRepository - Follow relationship queries
- IUserRepository - User data access

## Usage

```csharp
// Create ViewModel
var viewModel = new SocialFeedViewModel(
    socialFeedService,
    postService,
    currentUserId
);

// Set as DataContext
var view = new SocialFeedView
{
    DataContext = viewModel
};
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Virtualization**: Uses VirtualizingStackPanel for efficient rendering of large lists
2. **Caching**: First page cached to reduce server requests
3. **Pagination**: Loads posts in chunks to minimize initial load time
4. **Lazy Loading**: Images loaded on-demand as user scrolls

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time updates via SignalR when new posts are created
- Filter options (by user, date range, content type)
- Search functionality within feed
- Bookmark/save posts for later
- Share posts to other platforms
